Description: redPATH reconstructs the pseudo development time of cell lineages in single-cell RNA-seq data. It models the cell developmental process as a Hamiltonian path problem and attempts to recover the pseudo development time in single-cell RNA-seq datasets. redPATH is a comprehensive biological analysis software tool for analyzing single-cell data with robust performance.
